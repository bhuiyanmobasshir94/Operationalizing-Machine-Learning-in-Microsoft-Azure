# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure

In this project,I will continue to work with the `Bank Marketing dataset`. I will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. I will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

## Project Main Steps

In this project, I will be following the below steps:
- Authentication
- Automated ML Experiment
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger Documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline
- Documentation

## Steps

### Authentication

As I am using the lab, Udacity provided to me, I am not authorized to create a security principal and so I skipped this step.

### Automated ML Experiment
